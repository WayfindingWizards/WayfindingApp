# WayfindingApp

## Overview

The Wayfinding App is a mobile application to assist students, faculty, and visitors in navigating Minnesota State University's campus through an indoor positioning system supported by BLE Beacons.

## Prerequisites 

* Unity version 2021.3.22f1
* React Native
* Android Studio or Xcode (depending on what OS you're working with)
* Node.js

## Android Installation
1. Clone the WayfindingApp and UnityModel repos into the directory of your choice: 
	- https://github.com/WayfindingWizards/WayfindingApp.git 
	- https://github.com/WayfindingWizards/UnityModel.git 

2. Open a command line at the root of the WayfindingApp folder

3. Run the command `npm i` to see if npm is good and up to date: 
	- result should be: ```found 0 vulnerabilities``` and will provide you a notice if there are updates to any npm packages. 

4. Install React Native Unity with the following command:
	- ```npm install react-native node @azesmway/react-native-unity``` 

5. Install React Native Sensors with the following command: 
   	- ```npm install react-native-sensors --save``` 

6. Go to WayfindingApp\android and create a file called 'local.properties' inside the android folder

7. open local.properties in your IDE of choice and add the following: 
	- sdk.dir = *path to sdk* 
	- On Windows, if you installed Android Studio the path to the SDK is usually C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk. Use double backslashes to 	  separate path components in the local.properties file, e.g. sdk.dir = C:\\users\\student\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk

8. Still inside WayfindingApp\android, find the file called build.gradle inside the folder and make sure this line shows the correct ndk version(download from android studio):  
	- `ndkVersion = "21.3.6528147"`
	- *To download the NDK, open Android Studio app. Open the ‘More Actions’ dropdown menu to select ‘SDK Manager’. In the ‘SDK Tools’ tab scroll down until 	  you see ‘NDK (side by side)’ then select the NDK version 21.3.6528147. Click apply in the bottom right corner click the Apply button and wait for the 	  ndk to download. 

9. Also inside WayfindingApp\android, find the settings.gradle inside the android folder, and replace the line `include ':app'` with: 
	- `include ':app', ':react-native-unity-view', ':unityLibrary'`

10. Go to WayfindingApp\unity\builds\android\unityLibrary\src\main and find the AndroidManifest.xml file and delete the code inside of the intent-filters:
	- `</intent-filter> ... </intent-filter>`

11. Go to WayfindingApp\unity\builds\android\unityLibrary and find build.gradle file, once there ensure that the following is present: 
	- `ndkVersion = "21.3.6528147"`

12. Go to WayfindingApp\unity\builds\android\local.properties and make sure the path to the sdk and ndk lead to those installed by android studio: 
	- sdk.dir = path to sdk
	- ndk.dir = path to ndk
	- On Windows, if you installed Android Studio the path to the SDK is usually C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk. Use double backslashes to 	  separate path components in the local.properties file, e.g. sdk.dir = C:\\users\\student\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk 
	- On Windows, if you installed Android Studio the path to the NDK is usually C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\ndk version. Use 
	  double backslashes to separate path components in the local.properties file, e.g. ndk.dir = C:\\Users\\student\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk\\ndk\\21.3.6528147 

13. Go to WayfindingApp\unity\builds\android\unityLibrary\symbols and unzip 'arm64-v8a', 'armeabi-v7a,x86', and 'x86_64' inside the symbols folder (These are a part of the Unity model and were too large for GitHub to accept normally)

14. In your command prompt, change into the WayfindingApp\android directory and run the following commands:
	- ```gradlew.bat clean```
	- ```gradlew.bat assembleDebug```

## After Making Changes to the Android Unity Model

3. Under Platform, click Android 

4. Make sure the Export Project box is checked 

5. Click the Export Button 

6. Go to WayfindingApp/unity/builds/android and export 

7. Open the command prompt and navigate to WayfindingApp\android 

8. Run `gradlew.bat assembleDebug` 

9. When this finishes, Switch to the root of the WayfindingApp folder in a command prompt

10. Run `npx react-native start`

11. Press A to launch on Android. 

## iOS Installation
1. Install Xcode from the App Store 

2. Clone the WayfindingApp and UnityModel repos into the directory of your choice:

	- Restart your terminal after the previous command before running the next 2 
	- ```eval “$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)”``` 
	- ```brew install cocoapods```

7. Install CocoaPods to the WayfindingApp’s iOS folder by running this command in a terminal inside the iOS folder: 
	- ```pod install```
 	- *Note: If you run into a 'Invalid Podfile' error, try running ```npm audit fix``` before you run the command above 

8. Go to the WayfindingApp project directory, open a terminal, and run the command: 
	- ```npm install```
	- In order to open the project in Xcode, open WayFindingApp > ios > AwesomeProject.xcworkspace  
	- You will need to sign the project using your Apple ID for it work on iOS devices:
 		- In Xcode, under targets, select ‘AwesomeProject’, navigate to the ‘Signing & Capabilities’ tab. Under ‘Signing’ select the 'Team Identifier’ 			  dropdown menu and click ‘Add an account’.
